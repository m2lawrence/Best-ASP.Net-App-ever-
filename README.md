# Best-ASP.Net-App-ever-2016
VB, ASP.Net, SQL, HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap Javascript. Also done in C#.

I built this App so that data can be Inserted, Updated and Deleted to the Customer, Order and Product tables using a frontend 
ASP.Net website and a backend SQL Database.

I can create C# Objects: Class Object = new Class() 
Arrays:  char[] arrayName = new char[]{'M','i','k','e'};
I also know OOP.
