VB, ASP.Net, SQL, HTML5, CSS3 &amp; Bootstrap Javascript. Also done in C#.

I built this App so that data can be Inserted, Updated and Deleted to the Customer, Order and Product tables usind a frontend 
ASP.Net website and a backend SQL Database.

This App is wrote in VB pages and is also wrote in C# pages.
